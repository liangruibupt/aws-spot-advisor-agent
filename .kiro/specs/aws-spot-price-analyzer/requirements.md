# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an AWS spot price analyzer that identifies the top 3 AWS regions offering the lowest spot prices for specific EC2 instance types (p5en.48xlarge and p5.48xlarge) while maintaining low interruption rates below 5%. The system will leverage AWS Bedrock AgentCore and web scraping capabilities to gather real-time data from the AWS EC2 Spot Instance Advisor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud infrastructure engineer, I want to query the best AWS regions for spot instances, so that I can optimize costs while maintaining service reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests spot price analysis THEN the system SHALL query data for p5en.48xlarge and p5.48xlarge instance types
2. WHEN analyzing regions THEN the system SHALL only consider regions with interruption rates below 5%
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL return exactly 3 regions ranked by lowest spot price
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include region name, current spot price, and interruption rate for each result

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cost optimization specialist, I want real-time spot pricing data, so that I can make informed decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching pricing data THEN the system SHALL access the AWS EC2 Spot Instance Advisor web page at https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/instance-advisor/
2. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL use AWS Bedrock AgentCore to process the web content
3. WHEN data is older than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL refresh the data automatically
4. IF the web page is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data filtering, so that I can trust the recommendations for production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering regions THEN the system SHALL exclude any region with interruption rate >= 5%
2. WHEN insufficient regions meet criteria THEN the system SHALL return available regions with a warning
3. WHEN spot prices are unavailable for a region THEN the system SHALL exclude that region from results
4. WHEN multiple regions have identical prices THEN the system SHALL use interruption rate as a secondary sort criterion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this service, I want structured output, so that I can easily consume the results programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL provide data in JSON format
2. WHEN formatting output THEN the system SHALL include timestamp of data collection
3. WHEN presenting prices THEN the system SHALL include currency denomination (USD)
4. WHEN displaying interruption rates THEN the system SHALL format as percentages with 2 decimal places
